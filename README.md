# Face recognition

This mainly uses this [API](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) for the face detection and recognition.

## Concepts

Faces are saved into a model, which is used to recognize persons in photos.

There are 2 scripts:
* model.py: used to create, visualize or remove from the model.
* recognize_faces.py: used to detect and recognize faces in a given photo, thanks to the built model.
